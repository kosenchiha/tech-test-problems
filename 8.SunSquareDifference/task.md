## Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 x 12 + 22 x 22 + ... + 102 x102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)x(1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.
